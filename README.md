# Discord-Bot-DB-Converter
Converter for already existing databases

The jar has to be in the same directory as your current database.
Rename the current database to ***src.db***.
After successfully executing the jar, a new file called ***dest.db*** should have been created.
Rename the ***dest.db*** file to ***data.db*** and use it for **Gruwie**.
